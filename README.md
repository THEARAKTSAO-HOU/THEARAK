My name is KUCHKUNTHEARAK HOU, I GO by Thearak Tsao-Hou and I'm excited to join the team as a Junior Analyst. I have a strong background in e-commerce data analysis, with experience in turning complex data into strategic insights that support decision-making. I'm skilled in tools like Tableau, SQL, and Excel, which I’ve used extensively for visualizing and analyzing business performance, profitability, and return trends.

I’m passionate about creating clear, impactful dashboards and telling stories through data that can lead to meaningful improvements. I enjoy collaborating with teams to solve problems and am always eager to learn and take on new challenges. I look forward to contributing to our projects, sharing my knowledge, and growing with the team.

Please feel free to reach out—I’m always open to connecting and collaborating!# THEARAK
